// RaftInterface -- this is the "service interface" that is implemented by each Raft peer using the
// remote library from Lab 1.  it supports five remote methods that you must define and implement.
// these methods are described as follows:
//
//  1. RequestVote -- this is one of the remote calls defined in the Raft paper, and it should be
//     supported as such.  you will need to include whatever argument types are needed per the Raft
//     algorithm, and you can package the return values however you like, as long as the last return
//     type is `remote.RemoteObjectError`, since that is required for the remote library use.
//
//  2. AppendEntries -- this is one of the remote calls defined in the Raft paper, and it should be
//     supported as such and defined in a similar manner to RequestVote above.
//
//  3. GetCommittedCmd -- this is a remote call that is used by the Controller in the test code. it
//     allows the Controller to check the value of a commmitted log entry at a given index. the
//     type of the function is given below, and it must be implemented as given, otherwise the test
//     code will not function correctly.  more detail about this method is available later in this
//     starter code file.
//
//  4. GetStatus -- this is a remote call that is used by the Controller to collect status information
//     about the Raft peer.  the struct type that it returns is defined above, and it must be implemented
//     as given, or the Controller and test code will not function correctly.  more detail below.
//
//  5. NewCommand -- this is a remote call that is used by the Controller to emulate submission of
//     a new command value by a Raft client.  upon receipt, it will initiate processing of the command
//     and reply back to the Controller with a StatusReport struct as defined above. it must be
//     implemented as given, or the test code will not function correctly.  more detail below

// general notes:
//
// - you are welcome to use additional helper to handle various aspects of the Raft algorithm logic
//   within the scope of a single Raft peer.  you should not need to create any additional remote
//   calls between Raft peers or the Controller.  if there is a desire to create additional remote
//   calls, please talk with the course staff before doing so.
//
// - please make sure to read the Raft paper (https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) before attempting
//   any coding for this lab.  you will most likely need to refer to it many times during your
//   implementation and testing tasks, so please consult the paper for algorithm details.
//
// - each Raft peer will accept a lot of remote calls from other Raft peers and the Controller,
//   so use of locks / mutexes is essential.  you are expected to use locks correctly in order to
//   prevent race conditions in your implementation.  the Makefile supports testing both without
//   and with go's race detector, and the final auto-grader will enable the race detector, which will
//   cause tests to fail if any race conditions are encountered.
